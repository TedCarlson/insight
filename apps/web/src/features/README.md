# Features

Shared product features (Roster, Planning, Metrics) live here.

Surfaces (Admin/Leadership/Technician) should remain thin:
- layout + navigation
- surface-specific capability gates
- composition of feature modules

Feature modules own:
- UI (tables/forms/overlays)
- data access wrappers
- local state orchestration
